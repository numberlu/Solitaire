Start:
In Solitaire class we'll launch the window for solitaire (green) w/ a place for foundations and we'll go to the
Stack class to get a deck of cards and then shuffles them (use Random (0 to 52) or Collections.shuffle).
Before this the cards will be initiated as in we need to get 52 cards from the Card class and put it into an ArrayList (somehow :p). 
The deck will then be placed on the tableau and stock. 
  Tableau: 
  for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < 7; j++) {
      //place the card only if i position is equal or larger than j
      //so on column 1 there only be 1 card, on column 2 there will be 2 cards and so on
      if (i > j) {
        card.placeFaceDown(column i, position j); //pseudo code
        card.FaceDown = true;
      } else if (i == j) {    //The last card of the column is face up, all other are face down.
        card.placeFaceUp(column i, position j);
        card.FaceDown = false;
  } } }
