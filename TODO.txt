Start:
In Solitaire class we'll launch the window for solitaire (green) w/ foundation place and we'll go to the
stack class to get a shuffeled deck of cards (use Random (0 to 52) or Collections.shuffle).
Before this the cards will be initiated as in we need to get 52 cards from the Card class and put it into an ArrayList (somehow). 
The deck will then be placed on the tableau and stock. 
The last card of the column is face up, all other are face down.
